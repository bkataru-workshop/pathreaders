# pathreaders

Rust CLI utility to list, search, and interact with the contents of the PATH environment variable

## todo

- follow [Command Line Applications in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html) to flesh out this application and publish to crates.io
- add more CLI based functionality (need to brainstorm this)
